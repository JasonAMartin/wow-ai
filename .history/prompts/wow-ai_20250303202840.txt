I want to create an application to keep track of my activity in the World of Warcraft. Baiscally I am using AI to be my WoW assistant but I need to keep data for memory, analysis, etc.

This application will be NEXTJS and will interface with a database (or more if needed).

I want a docker compose file with required components. This is on my main machine.

Here are some tasks along with how I envision them:

1. /add-delve-run -> I want a form to enter a delve run. When I hit the "ADD DELVE RUN" button it needs to add the run to the database. Also I want it to output text that I can copy/paste to AI.

The form will have: delve name (this will be dropdown. Please look up delve names in WoW and add them), tier level (drop down 1-11), character (drop down: protection paladin, bm hunter, guardian druid), brann level (drop down 28-80), bran spec (drop down: healer, dps, tank), Curios (drop down: look up Curios and add 1 dropdown per rank too. Example: Porcelain Arrowhead Rank 1/4, Porcelain Arrowhead Rank 2/4, etc). My item level (text box), boss kill time (text box), notes (text area). Also there will be a piece of data "date run" that is the current date like:  March 03, 2025 that should be added to the record.

After adding to the database the text area below should populate with something like this:

New Delve Run!

Character: BM Hunter
Tier: 5
Delve: Mycomancer Cavern
Brann Level: 28
Brann Spec: healer
Curios: Porcelain Arrowhead Idol Rank 3/4 and Amorphous Relic rank 3/4
My Item Level: 596
Boss Kill Time: 51 seconds
Notes: Run was easy. No health issues.
Date Run: March 03, 2025

2. /get-delve-runs -> On this page I want to get all delve run data and it should be in text area so I can copy/paste. I want it formated in JSON like this:

{
    runs: [
        {record 1},
        {record 2},
        etc.
    ]
}

3. /home -> whatever the default homepage is. Should have links to all the possible action pages.

4. /update-inventory -> This is going to be a page that I paste in a JSON object and have the database update. We will work on the code for this in next steps.

5. /update-talents -> Just make placeholder

6. /update-currency -> just make placeholder

7. /update-curios -> just make placeholder

8. /update-stats -> just make placeholder

9. /update-gear -> just make placeholder

10. /get-inventory -> Just make placeholder

11. /get-talents -> just make placeholder 

12. /get-currency -> Just make placeholder

13. /get curios -> Just make placeholder

14. /get-stats -> Just make placeholder

15. /get-gear -> Just make placeholder

16. /store-ai-context -> just make placeholder but I'm going to paste in a data dump from AI so I can pick up conversations later. This will be AI context paste. I will want the date on these too.

17. /get-latest-ai-context -> I will want to select the most recent context. but you can placeholder this page too. We will work on it later.


For the database or databases not sure what one to use or if I need multiples. Please recommend.

For the inventory, talents, currency, curios, stats, brann and gear I will be pasting in JSON. Each of these items will be tied to a specific character and I have many characters. So each character has inventory, talents, currency, etc.

Here is an example of each data item:


INVENTORY (NOTE: the key like "0-11" is not important, Just a key my addon makes.):

      "inventory": {
            "0-11": {
            "name": "Empty Polyformic Acid Vial",
            "quantity": 1
            },
            "3-23": {

      },

        },
        "Sinstone Fragments": {
          "maxQuantity": 0,
          "quantity": 712
        }
      }

          "1": {
            "name": "Idol of Final Will",
            "rank": 1
          },
          "2": {
            "name": "Porcelain Arrowhead Idol",
            "rank": 1
          }
        }

      }

      "gear": {
        "1": {
          "itemLevel": 606,

          "upgrade": "Veteran 8/8"
        },
        "2": {
          "itemLevel": 584,
          "name": "Moneyed Mariner's Pendant",
          "upgrade": "Veteran 1/8"
        }
      },

And the Characters data will be a table with ID (something to pin other data to), class, spec, overallItemLevel


Please ask any questions you have or what you need to know before we start the code generation.
